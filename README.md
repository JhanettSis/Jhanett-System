## üí° Agile Methodology & SDLC in Practice

### üå± **Agile Scrum**: The Key to Effective Collaboration

In the development of several projects like my **Restaurant Ordering System** and **Skyline Escapes Travel Agency Website**, I‚Äôve utilized **Agile Scrum** methodology to ensure flexibility, continuous improvement, and timely delivery of features. Agile allows me to break down large, complex projects into manageable chunks, prioritize tasks, and continuously deliver value. Here‚Äôs how I apply Agile principles:

- **Product Backlog**: I begin with a product backlog, which lists all the required features and functionalities.
- **Sprints**: The backlog is divided into **sprints** (usually 2-week cycles) where I focus on delivering specific tasks such as **user authentication**, **menu management**, or **payment gateway integration**.
- **Daily Standups (Self-managed)**: Although I often work solo, I still use Agile practices like daily standups to keep track of my progress, identify blockers, and set goals for the day.
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: After each sprint, I review what worked and what didn‚Äôt. This helps improve my workflow and adapt quickly to changes in the project.

### üîÑ **SDLC**: Structuring the Development Process

I follow a well-defined **SDLC process** to ensure the consistency and quality of the applications I develop. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how I apply each phase:

1. **Planning & Requirement Analysis**: 
    - I begin by understanding the project requirements through discussion with stakeholders or through course objectives (when working solo).
    - I define project goals, technical requirements, and constraints, which allows me to create a roadmap.

2. **Design**:
    - Once the requirements are clear, I design the architecture using frameworks like **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) for cleaner, maintainable code.
    - This phase also includes **UI/UX design**, ensuring that the application is intuitive and user-friendly.

3. **Implementation**:
    - During the **implementation phase**, I start coding based on the design documents, breaking tasks into manageable pieces, as described in my **Agile Sprints**.
    - I prioritize **security** and **performance** as part of the implementation process to ensure the application is robust and scalable.

4. **Testing**:
    - Throughout development, I continuously test the application using **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **manual testing** to ensure everything works as expected.
    - **Bug tracking** for example in laravel I used Seeders to create a fake data ** this help me manage issues efficiently during this phase.

5. **Deployment**:
    - I ensure a smooth **continuous integration** and **continuous deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline is in place for future updates.

6. **Maintenance**:
    - Even after deployment, I continuously monitor the application for any issues, applying patches and updating features as needed.
    - I use **feedback loops** to improve the application based on user input and system performance.
